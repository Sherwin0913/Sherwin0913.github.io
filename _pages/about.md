# Hello, I'm [Xuewen Xiang]! 👋

🎓 I am currently studying at the School of Mathematics at Southeast University, majoring in **Systems Science**. I completed my undergraduate studies at the School of Mathematics at Southwest Jiaotong University, where I majored in **Data Science and Big Data Technology**.

🔍 My research interests include **multi-agent reinforcement learning**, **intelligent decision-making**, and **optimal control**. I am passionate about leveraging advanced mathematical and computational techniques to develop systems capable of autonomous and optimized decision-making.

🌐 Feel free to explore my repositories and projects. Let's connect and discuss ideas in data science, machine learning, and intelligent systems!

🏆 During my undergraduate studies, I received two **National Scholarships** (2022-2023 and 2023-2024 academic years), earned the honor of **Excellent Student** three times, and was recognized as an **Outstanding Graduate of Sichuan Province**.

🔬 I also participated in two research projects:
1. **Research on Optimization Technology and System for Stage Planning of Railway Container Hub Stations**, a National SRTP project for 2024-2025, supervised by Professor Jun Zhao from the School of Transportation and Logistics at Southwest Jiaotong University.
2. **Application of Lip-reading Recognition Based on Deep Learning in Education for People with Disabilities**, a university-level SRTP project for 2022-2023, supervised by Professor Meng Yang from the School of Mathematics at Southwest Jiaotong University.

📄 I will be adding information about my related papers to this homepage in the future.
